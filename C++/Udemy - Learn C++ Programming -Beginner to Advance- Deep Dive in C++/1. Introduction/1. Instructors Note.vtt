Hi.

1
00:01.990 --> 00:06.440
Before you start in the course let me guide you how to follow this course.

2
00:06.650 --> 00:15.030
See this courses for beginners who are pursuing C++ as their part of academics and also useful for those

3
00:15.030 --> 00:21.450
who are going to attend job interviews and even if you are a professional programmer and you want to

4
00:21.450 --> 00:26.570
use C++ in your application development the course is definitely useful for you.

5
00:26.670 --> 00:31.410
So if you are a beginner then you will be learning right from the very basics to the advanced level

6
00:31.860 --> 00:33.400
of C++ programming.

7
00:34.110 --> 00:38.060
So if you are a beginner don't skip any video right.

8
00:38.060 --> 00:39.190
Don't skip any video.

9
00:39.330 --> 00:44.960
The beginning first two sections are covering the essential fundamentals that are required for learning

10
00:45.090 --> 00:46.650
any programming language.

11
00:46.650 --> 00:49.660
So if you have never done any programming you are very new to it.

12
00:49.950 --> 00:53.680
Then don't skip anything and follow each and every video.

13
00:53.730 --> 01:00.120
Step by step then next thing, in every video, wherever I have discussed a programs.

14
01:00.210 --> 01:04.640
I have written the programs on whiteboard. After listening to the lecture.

15
01:04.640 --> 01:10.840
Better you prepare some notes and also you try to write on the program by yourself on your own machine

16
01:10.900 --> 01:14.560
that is in your own environment that is own IDE

17
01:14.730 --> 01:20.600
And if you face any problem then you can watch our demo video next to the topic so every topic is having

18
01:20.600 --> 01:24.200
a demo movie do after that and also along with the demo video.

19
01:24.200 --> 01:30.350
There is an attachment of the program that is shown in the demo video. so I suggest you to practice

20
01:30.350 --> 01:36.920
it by yourself first and practicing C++ programming is more important just listening to the lectures

21
01:36.920 --> 01:38.020
will not help you.

22
01:38.090 --> 01:43.280
The more you practice the more programs you write the more confidence you'll get and you'll get more

23
01:43.280 --> 01:45.650
used to it C++ programming.

24
01:45.650 --> 01:48.980
And there are some student exercises at the end of each section.

25
01:49.160 --> 01:55.500
You try to complete them and for them also a demonstration video as well as a PDF file  

26
01:55.500 --> 01:56.990
is also available for it.

27
01:57.930 --> 02:03.410
And at the end of the course there is a student project a small student project at the end of C++ scores.

28
02:03.740 --> 02:10.340
I suggest you to complete that project by yourself and for that also a demonstration and the code is

29
02:10.340 --> 02:15.070
given, that is PDF and for every section there is some quiz.

30
02:15.080 --> 02:20.960
Try to attempt them those questions and if you have answered wrong then I suggest you to just watch the

31
02:21.290 --> 02:25.430
relevant videos for once again. And at any stage.

32
02:25.430 --> 02:30.860
If you face any difficulty if you have any queries if you have any questions just feel free to post

33
02:30.860 --> 02:31.840
a question to me.

34
02:31.940 --> 02:33.460
I will reply quickly.

35
02:33.500 --> 02:39.590
I will give you an instant replay on that one and if you are having any errors while writing the programs

36
02:39.590 --> 02:46.730
and all I suggest you to send a screenshot right so that I can quickly answer you so you can post a

37
02:46.730 --> 02:52.760
question so that I can I should be able to understand your question and quickly answer it right so

38
02:53.000 --> 02:53.870
don't hesitate.

39
02:53.960 --> 02:57.170
I'm always there with you through out this course.

40
02:57.290 --> 03:02.670
Alright so hope you enjoy the course and learn a lot of things in C++ in this course.
